      When possible, we believe in repairing rather than replacing products that need service in order to extend the product’s life and keep
      products out of landfills. For any manufacturing defects during the warranty period, repairs are on us. If a product cannot be
      repaired, we will offer a replacement if the product is still available. If the product is not available, we will offer a refund or
      store credit.
