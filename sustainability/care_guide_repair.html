        Cuyana is committed to the quality of our products with a two year warranty policy. We are happy to handle complimentary repairs for issues resulting in manufacturing defects within this two year period. If items cannot be repaired, we will replace the item as long as the stock is available. This warranty does not cover normal wear and tear.
        If general wear and tear has affected the productsâ€™ appearance, we suggest visiting a leather care professional for refurbishment.
