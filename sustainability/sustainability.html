  <p class="copy2">
    Many of our vendors are small family-run businesses, supporting heritage production techniques that have largely been left
    behind by modern mass manufacturing. These mills and factories are often the pillars of their local communities and
    producing with them supports local economies around the world.
  </p>
  <p class="copy2">
    All of our factories have either been independently audited for social compliance or have agreed to our Cuyana vendor terms,
    which include compliance with local labor laws. Our suppliers are like family to us, and we frequently visit them as we
    co-create products to ensure the highest quality and so that our relationship continues to mean more than just business.
  </p>
  <p class="copy2">
    Our supply chain is different from many other brands in minimizing our carbon footprint by manufacturing in close proximity
    to our material sources whenever possible. It is common practice in the industry for the raw material to be produced across
    the globe from where the final product is made, requiring shipping from raw material to factory and then factory to store.
    We intentionally select factories that are located near the source - for example, our Pima Cotton is grown, spun, and made
    into finished garments all in Peru.

  <div class="sticky-nav title6" data-desktop-nav="sub-nav-section-2" onclick="">Maximize Wears<span class="toggle-state"></span></div>
  <p class="copy2">
    We believe that an essential piece of sustainability is getting the most use possible out of your Fewer, Better
    pieces. Because we have been trained to treat our wardrobes as disposable, Americans now buy on average 68 items
    of clothing a year and an UK study showed that each piece of clothing is worn just 7 times before being discarded.
  </p>
  <p class="copy2">
    The impact this has on our planet is twofold: first, we are using more resources than ever in producing over 100
    billion garments a year worldwide - which is double what we produced in 2000. Second, these discarded garments
    must go somewhere - and now 60% of all clothing ends up in incinerators or landfills within a year of being
    produced.
  </p>
  <p class="copy2">
    Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to us that you are able to love our pieces for years to come. To that end,
    we commit to helping you keep them in your closet through thoughtful design, upholding quality, supporting you in
    care & repair, and inspiring ways to keep your beloved items fresh season after season. And not only will keeping
    them in your closet reduce our impact on the environment, it also delivers a superior price per wear for your
    wallet.
  </p>

  <div id="section-2-1" class="offset-anchor"></div>
  <div class="sub-sticky-nav title6" data-desktop-nav="sub-nav-section-2-1">Design</div>

  <p class="copy2">
    Intentional design is at the core of our fewer, better philosophy. When designing any product, we first ask
    ourselves whether it is timeless, functional, and versatile - an item that you will feel chic wearing year after
    year. But we don’t mistake basic for boring: all of our clothing has composed design details that create a focal
    point for the feminine form and all our leather goods combine beauty with function to become your trusted daily
    companions. We design so that you fall in love with what you wear for years to come, creating a bigger impact on
    your closet and a smaller impact on the world.

  <p class="copy2">
    Quality is the key to product longevity and is carefully considered for each product hand-in-hand with design. Every
    piece in our collection meets a quality standard defined by craftsmanship, integrity, and best-in-class materials.
    And while many brands tout quality, few are willing to back up their claims.
 </p>
  <p class="copy2">
    At Cuyana, we select many of the finest materials available on the market so that you are able to wear and love our
    products for longer. For example, our silk is between 25-30 mommes in density versus an industry standard of 16-19
    mommes, lending a luxurious weight and the longevity to endure many washes and wears. Our superfine 100% Baby Alpaca
    is just 20 microns in thickness, which is more durable and pill-resistant than the lower grades of Alpaca blended
    with synthetics used by other brands. Because quality materials and design are upheld as equally important inputs to
    product development, we are able to ensure that each product we bring to life is made with high-quality care and
    rafted to stand the test of time.

  <p class="copy2">
    Giving back to women in need has been a core part of our brand since we first launched our Lean Closet program in
    partnership with H.E.A.R.T. (Helping Ease Abuse Related Trauma) in 2013. At the time, it was common for
    philanthropic brands to operate under a “buy one, give one” model, where for each product sold, a less quality
    item was also produced and donated. We approached things differently, creating a takeback program so that our
    customers had the opportunity to pass along their gently used high quality Cuyana items directly to women healing
    from abusive situations at H.E.A.R.T. We believe this approach is better for both the environment as well as the
    women who ultimately receive and use the items.
  </p>
  <p class="copy2">
    While our resale partnership with thredUP evolved the original program to expand its reach (more on that below!),
    we still regularly hold in-store donation drives benefiting H.E.A.R.T., and as a company we donate our production
    samples to H.E.A.R.T.
