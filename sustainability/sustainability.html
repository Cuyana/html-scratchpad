    Our Fewer, Better Promise
  </div>

    We treat our wardrobes as disposable. Americans buy on average 68 items of clothing a year. A UK study showed that
    each garment is worn just seven times before being discarded.
  </p>
  <p class="copy-m-reg">
    We are using more resources than ever before in producing over 100 billion garments a year worldwide - double what
    was produced in 2000. Sixty percent of discarded garments end up in incinerators or landfills within a year of being
    produced. </p>
  <p class="copy-m-reg">
    We don’t need more clothes. Our landfills don’t need more clothes. We need fewer, better things. </p>
  <p class="copy-m-reg">
    In pursuit of this goal, we commit to create products responsibly, enable you to maximize their wear, and provide a
    way to recycle every product through second life programs. </p>

    We care deeply about how each product is made and its impact on the environment, and we have intentionally built our
    supply chain to support responsible production from raw material to finished good.

  <p class="copy2">
    Many of our vendors are small family-run businesses, supporting heritage production techniques that have largely
    been left behind by modern mass manufacturing. These mills and factories are often the pillars of their local
    communities and producing with them supports local economies around the world.
  </p>

  <p class="copy2">
    All of our factories have either been independently audited for social compliance or have agreed to our Cuyana
    vendor terms, which include compliance with local labor laws. Our suppliers are like family to us, and we frequently
    visit them as we co-create products to ensure the highest quality and so that our relationship continues to mean
    more than just business.
  </p>
  <p class="copy2">
    Our supply chain is different from many other brands in minimizing our carbon footprint by manufacturing in close
    proximity to our material sources whenever possible. It is common practice in the industry for the raw material to
    be produced across the globe from where the final product is made, requiring shipping from raw material to factory
    and then factory to store. We intentionally select factories that are located near the source - for example, our
    Pima Cotton is grown, spun, and made into finished garments all in Peru.

      Intentional design is at the core of our fewer, better philosophy. When designing any product, we first ask
      ourselves whether it is timeless, functional, and versatile - an item that you will feel chic wearing year after
      year. But we don’t mistake basic for boring: all of our clothing has composed design details that create a focal
      point for the feminine form and all our leather goods combine beauty with function to become your trusted daily
      companions. We design so that you fall in love with what you wear for years to come, creating a bigger impact on
      your closet and a smaller impact on the world.

    <p class="copy2">
      Quality is the key to product longevity and is carefully considered for each product hand-in-hand with design.
      Every piece in our collection meets a quality standard defined by craftsmanship, integrity, and best-in-class
      materials. And while many brands tout quality, few are willing to back up their claims.
    </p>
    <p class="copy2">
      At Cuyana, we select many of the finest materials available on the market so that you are able to wear and love
      our products for longer. For example, our silk is between 25-30 mommes in density versus an industry standard of
      16-19 mommes, lending a luxurious weight and the longevity to endure many washes and wears. Our superfine 100%
      Baby Alpaca is just 20 microns in thickness, which is more durable and pill-resistant than the lower grades of
      Alpaca blended with synthetics used by other brands. Because quality materials and design are upheld as equally
      important inputs to product development, we are able to ensure that each product we bring to life is made with
      high-quality care and crafted to stand the test of time.

      We want to put an end to the notion that your wardrobe is disposable, and encourage our first instinct to be to
      repair rather than replace. Over time, this practice will extend the life of your products and increase your price
      per wear, slow consumption and reduce unnecessary waste.

    We believe fashion should always be inspirational - you should always look forward to getting dressed. Once it is
    time for you to make space for the new by moving on from your beloved Cuyana pieces, we want you to empower you to
    do so without guilt. Our Lean Closet program is designed to keep your Cuyana pieces out of landfill by giving them a
    second life.

  <p class="copy2">
    Giving back to women in need has been a core part of our brand since we first launched our Lean Closet program in
    partnership with H.E.A.R.T. (Helping Ease Abuse Related Trauma) in 2013. At the time, it was common for
    philanthropic brands to operate under a “buy one, give one” model, where for each product sold, a less quality
    item was also produced and donated. We approached things differently, creating a takeback program so that our
    customers had the opportunity to pass along their gently used high quality Cuyana items directly to women healing
    from abusive situations at H.E.A.R.T. We believe this approach is better for both the environment as well as the
    women who ultimately receive and use the items.
  </p>
  <p class="copy2">
    While our resale partnership with thredUP evolved the original program to expand its reach (more on that below!),
    we still regularly hold in-store donation drives benefiting H.E.A.R.T., and as a company we donate our production
    samples to H.E.A.R.T.
