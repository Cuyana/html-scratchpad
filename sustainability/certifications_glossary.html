  <p class="copy2">
    Although the fashion industry is slowly recognizing the need for standardized measurement and verification of responsible production,
    there is currently no single independent certification standard. Many certifications focus primarily on just one step of the production
    process: either how the raw material was produced, or the environmental management of the mill or tannery where the raw material is
    transformed into fabric or leather.
  </p>
  <p class="copy2">
    We welcome you to learn more about the environmental certifications that independently verify that our products were made responsibly,
    and which stage of the production process that certification aligns with. If you would like to know which ceritifications apply
    specifically to each of our products, that information can be found on each product description page.
