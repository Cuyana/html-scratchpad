        Read the care label for the garment, and follow as instructed. Some garments required to be dry clean only. We recommend using a green
        dry cleaner, if available. Delicate fabrics may be hand-washed in cold water with a gentle detergent. Eliminate water excess by laying
        your sweater flat inside a towel, roll the whole thing up, and squeeze as much excess water out as you can. Do not wring. Lay your
        semi-wet sweater out flat on a dry towel and leave it to dry. Steam to remove wrinkles, if necessary. To freshen between wears, spritz
        a delicate fabric spray with antibacterial properties to remove odor. Pilling naturally occurs on natural fibers. We recommend using a
        fabric comb to remove pilling.

    <div class="care-detail-title subtitle2">How to Store</div>
    <p class="copy2">
      Store folded, do not hang as garments may be pulled due to gravity.
    </p>
    <p class="copy2">
      For long-term storage, avoid plastic bins as they can attract moisture and bugs.
    </p>
    <p class="copy2">
      We recommend storing your garments in cotton storage bags as bugs can't eat through cotton, and the natural, breathable fabric helps
      the moisture escapeâ€”preventing it from being retained.
    </p>
    <p class="copy2">
      For best results, use a cedar block or sachet to keep your closet smelling fresh while naturally repelling moths and other insects.

        Spun in the hills of Bologna, our recycled cashmere is made at a family-owned mill that has been in business for over 130 years.
        This regenerative process gives a second life to materials that would otherwise go to waste by creating a beautiful new fabric that
        is designed to soften with each wear.

        A business passed down through multiple generations of women, the Peruvian factory that handles all of our alpaca production
        hand-selects only the finest alpaca fibers for our products. Naturally hypoallergenic and odor resistant, our alpaca is more durable
