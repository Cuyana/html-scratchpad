    <p class="copy2">
      Read the care label for the garment, and follow as instructed. Some garments required to be dry clean only. We recommend using a green dry cleaner, if available. Delicate fabrics may be hand-washed in cold water with a gentle detergent. Eliminate water excess by laying your sweater flat inside a towel, roll the whole thing up, and squeeze as much excess water out as you can. Do not wring. Lay your semi-wet sweater out flat on a dry towel and leave it to dry. Steam to remove wrinkles, if necessary. To freshen between wears, spritz a delicate fabric spray with antibacterial properties to remove odor. Pilling naturally occurs on natural fibers. We recommend using a fabric comb to remove pilling.

    <div class="care-detail-title subtitle2">How to Store</div>
    <p class="copy2">
  Store folded, do not hang as garments may be pulled due to gravity.
</p> <p class="copy2">
For long-term storage, avoid plastic bins as they can attract moisture and bugs.
</p> <p class="copy2">
We recommend storing your garments in cotton storage bags as bugs can't eat through cotton, and the natural, breathable fabric helps the moisture escapeâ€”preventing it from being retained.
</p> <p class="copy2">
For best results, use a cedar block or sachet to keep your closet smelling fresh while naturally repelling moths and other insects.
