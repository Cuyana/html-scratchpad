      various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained
      in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information
      internally in connection with our Services, including to
      personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set
      up a user account and profile, to contact you, to fulfill your
      requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you
      use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal
      Information with third parties, but only as described below.

    <p class="copy2">
      For this GDPR section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and
      “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data”
      generally means information that can be used to individually
      identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that
      can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use,
      storage and disclosure. Cuyana will be the controller of your
      Personal Data processed in connection with the Sites. Note that we
      may also process Personal Data of our customers’ end users or
      employees in connection with our provision of services to customers,
      in which case we are the processor of Personal Data. If we are the
      processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please
      contact the controller party in the first instance to address your
      rights with respect to such data.
